# CaptionMe Project

We are working on a project which has the goal to generate some categories about a given image.
To achieve this project we have listed the following steps :

## 1. Download the dataset and models from Merieme's drive

* Move the file to root directory

* complete "env" variables in main.py (only root path, the rest is default) to file

## 2. Run Method2
 * Running main.py preprocesses data, trains model, executes tests while showing graphs and images of the process
